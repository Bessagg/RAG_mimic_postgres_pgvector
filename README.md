## Setup

Define `OpenAI` and `Langchain` API keys in a file named `.env`.  
The required parameters are shown in the example file [`.env.example`](./.env.example).

## Langchain + OpenAI Example

This repository contains example notebooks demonstrating how to use Langchain with OpenAI.

## Example Notebooks

| Notebook | Description |
|---|---|
| [translate.ipynb](https://github.com/Bessagg/Langchain_examples/blob/master/translate.ipynb) | Notebook demonstrating translation using user prompts with Langchain and OpenAI. |

## Postgres + pgvector + AI + VectorScale

To set up PostgreSQL with AI capabilities, follow these steps:

1. Install the required extensions by running the SQL commands provided in `database/vector_and_ai_extensions_install.sql`. These extensions include:
   - **pgvector**: Enables vector similarity search in PostgreSQL, essential for AI-driven applications.
   - **ai and vectorscale**: Enhance PostgreSQL's ability to handle AI workloads efficiently.

2. Refer to this [tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua6LDIOVN1s&list=PLsceB9ac9MHR7IL2kSiHN8NUCmXoEEAf8) for a great guide of working with these extensions.

By integrating `pgvector` and other tools, this project enables efficient storage and querying of vector embeddings, making it suitable for AI and machine learning workflows.

### Running the Examples

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your `.env` file based on the provided [`.env.example`](./.env.example).
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VSCode and follow the instructions inside.

## Data Source

This project uses data from **EHR-CON: Consistency of Notes** (version 1.0.0), a small example database provided by PhysioNet. This dataset was selected due to its manageable size, making it suitable for development and testing purposes before scaling to larger datasets like MIMIC-IV.
